  While working for High Country Chemical Supplies we secured a large multi-state contract to supply janitorial supplies to the USPS. We designed and implemented a custom-built ordering system. This ordering system with its unique delivery infrastructure earned High Country the designation of supplier of the year for the USPS in 2001. We accepted this award on behalf of High Country Chemical Supplies at the USPS headquarters in Washington DC.

  My very first success at CAM2 was to collect money and retain business from a few customers that had gotten way too far behind. This set the stage for my future successes. These were customers that had past due balances exceeding $200,000. This one success pushed us up the ladder and gave us the ability to learn and have future successes.

  We developed and maintained an EFT (electronic funds transfer) payment process.

  My next success at CAM2 was to integrate a small company that was purchased 2 months prior to my arrival with no accounting completed. We got this purchase integration completed and correct in less than 30 days. We moved this small company form their old Quickbooks ERP to CAM2’s MS Dynamics platform as a separate division.

  At CAM2, we fixed and processed all sales, payroll, petroleum (oil & gas), gross receipts and business taxes.

  At CAM2, since the accounting operations were functioning so well we were also assigned the purchasing and customer service departments. This led to moving the office five times for growth over an 11-year span. This was done without utilizing moving companies.

  When CAM2 merged with International Petroleum creating CAM2 International, LLC we completed all the accounting with no issues including migrating to MS Dynamics.

  Due to this new business we built a system to track inventory monthly and annually for multiple warehouses.

  When CAM2 International purchased its first of two refineries from Chevron we successfully loaded all accounting functions to MS Dynamics GP. This included integrating the tower operations, payroll time management and 3rd party vendor billing.

  Soon a second refinery was purchased. The biggest challenge with this refinery was counting inventory and calculating product cost. This was not done before but we designed and implemented a process to make this happen prior to purchase date.

  Due to purchasing these refineries and acquiring bank financing we gained experience in ABL (asset based lending) reporting, bank account setup, cash requirements and daily borrowing base activity.

  This new bank financing had audit requirements annually and quarterly. We passed these audits every time by building processes, managing staff and auditing their work.

  During this time, we migrated CAM2’s accounting and operations from MS Dynamics to Chempax by Datacorp

  We also create and maintained daily a 13 - week cash flow analysis.

  In 2014 CAM2 was sold to Smitty’s Supply, Inc. we successfully migrated the CAM2 company onto its own platform using Chempax ERP. To do this we created: Chart of Accounts, GL Mapping, functionality and migrated all AR, AP and Inventory files. We also completed all final reconciliations.

  At Smitty’s Supply we built a new Chart of Accounts for each of their main 5 companies.

  We migrated an old PetroData ERP into their Chempax system. Even the vendor (Chempax) said this could not be done but we made it happen. The PetroData ERP was utilized for petroleum sales and petroleum taxes calculations and reporting.

  <left><br><h4 ><br>
  At Smitty’s we were tasked with building a database from multiple companies to sell a bulk plant and bulk business. The sale never happened because we proved that this business was profitable and vital to the company’s future. The company did not know this prior. We did this despite losing a large commission.
